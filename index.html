                <h2>NATURAL</h2>
                <p>Talk of "natural" language usually assumes a context in which language is the subject of scientific inquiry, or is processed by programming languages, but those focuses are covered elsewhere on this page. Natural language for its <em>own</em> sake is interesting to me as a reader.</p>

                <h2>MUSIC</h2>
                <p>Leptons interact only with photons, and with the intermediate bosons that presumably mediate weak interactions. What could be more natural than to unite these spin-one bosons into a multiplet of gauge fields? Standing in the way of this synthesis are the obvious dif- ferences in the masses of the photon and inter- mediate meson, and in their couplings. We might hope to understand these differences by imagining that the symmetries relating the weak and electromagnetic interactions are ex- act symmetries of the Lagrangian but are bro- ken by the vacuum. However, this raises the specter of unwanted massless Goldstone bosons. This note will describe a model in which the symmetry between the electromagnetic and weak interactions is spontaneously broken, but in which the Goldstone bosons are avoided by introducing the photon and the intermediate-boson fields as gauge fields. The model may be renormalizable.</p>

                <p>P1. I was once a researcher and lecturer in linguistics with interests centred upon formal syntax but ranging from evolutionary theory to philosophy of mind.</p>
                <p>P2. I continue to do research and have been striving for several years to finish a manuscript that seeks to reconcile the best of Chomskyan theory with the philosophy of Wittgenstein.</p>
                <p>P3. More to follow...</p>

                <h2>CODE</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:22px !important;"><span class="pound">$</span> on_weekdays, I work as a computational linguist for a company that specializes in speech recognition. My focus is on enhancing the naturalness of our text output, providing expert support for multi-lingual coverage thanks to a background in formal linguistics.</p>
                <p><span class="pound">$</span> at_other_times, I'm looking at the application of machine learning to music generation. To date, results in the field have been... mixed at best. Tantalizing gimmicks but no lasting intrigue or practical tools. I think this is because of conceptual shortcomings in the data we use, so I'm working on alternatives to generate improvisations that follow the rules of classical harmony. Demos soon.</p>
