                <p style="text-indent: 0px !important;">I used to be a researcher and lecturer in linguistics, specializing in formal syntax and the evolution of linguistic ability in our species. Today I still write on the science of natural language, with a focus on explaining how the field has curiously managed to make great progress while also having very shaky philosophical foundations. My lodestars are Chomsky and Wittgenstein and my hope is to reconcile what seems irreconcilable about them.</p>
                <p>Apart from my interest in the science of natural language...</p>

I bring my background in linguistics to bear on evaluating the quality of our modelling and enhancing the naturalness of our output across 30+ languages.</p>
                <p><span class="pound">$</span> at_other_times, I'm looking at the application of machine learning to music generation. To date, results in the field have been... mixed. Tantalizing gimmicks but no lasting, practical tools. I'm working on better ways of training models with plans to scale up over the next few years.</p>
