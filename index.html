                    <p>I used to be a researcher and lecturer in linguistics, and today I still write on the science of natural language. My view is that modern linguistics has made great progress in understanding the structure of languages but with very many misapprehensions about how this structure is computed by the brain. The reason for this, I think, is that linguists bring to the table too many unexamined assumptions about the mind, which need to be exposed by a return to mid-century philosophy of language.</p>
                    <p>For a while, I was a researcher and lecturer in linguistics, specializing in formal syntax and philosophy of mind. It was my view that linguists have convincing theories about the psychology of language, though we radically misunderstand their implications because the field is built on many unexamined philosophical assumptions. These days, I'm working on a book to lay these problems bare, <em>Idols of the Mind</em>.</p>
                    <p>Apart from my interest in the science of natural language...</p>

Tantalizing gimmicks but no lasting, practical tools. I'm working on better ways of training models with plans to scale up over the next few years.</p>
