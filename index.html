                    <h2>NATURAL</h2>
                    <p>I’m a researcher (and previously, lecturer) in linguistics, specializing in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar">generative grammar</a> and the evolution of linguistic ability in our species.</p>
                    <p>I’m finishing up a book, <em>Idols of the Mind</em>, which argues that modern linguistics has made great progress understanding the structure of languages as cultural artefacts but, while it has hoped to go beyond language description to offer theories of the underlying <em>psychology</em> of language, it hasn’t developed philosophical underpinnings that are robust enough for us to learn much about the mind at all.
                    <p>This claim comes as a surprise to many, especially to colleagues who believe that Chomsky revolutionized linguistics in the 1960s specifically by turning it into a cognitive science. But I’m not about to follow the empty-headed fashion for disparaging Chomsky’s achievements. I believe we can salvage the very best of Chomsky so long as we give up a few false premises he introduced early on that have never been rectified.
                    <p>This can only be done, I feel, by turning to alternative foundations in the works of philosophers like Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. This is unfamiliar territory for most, so spreading knowledge of these works is half the battle.</p>

                    <h2>MUSICAL</h2>
                    <p>I’m a freelance composer and pianist exploring ways of bringing classical idioms into soundtracks and other narrative media. This ranges from standard commissions for orchestral tracks to an ongoing project to reimagine a Mozart piano concerto for synth ensemble. Here’s a sample of a couple of short compositions:</p>

                    <p>I’m also working on a script for a podcast in which I’ll unpack the storytelling structure of classical music for a general listener, with self-produced examples.</p>
                    <p>Just for fun, here’s a performance of some Satie:</p>

                    <h2>LOGICAL</h2>
                    <p style="margin-top:16px !important;">$ I’m a developer for a company that does automatic speech recognition, where I bring my background in linguistics to bear on evaluating the quality of our models and enhancing the naturalness of our transcription output across 30+ languages.</p>
                    <p>$ In my time, I’m looking at the application of machine learning to music generation. To date, results in the field have been... mixed. Plenty of tantalizing gimmicks but little lasting impact and no practical tools.</p>
                    <p>$ I’m trying to design better models with the end goal of producing software that can take a short musical extract in MIDI format and realistically improvise in classical and pop styles. At the moment, this work is very speculative but I have ambitions to turn it into a commercial project over the next few years.</p>
                    <p>$ Part of this would involve a vision for the fair reimbursement of people who contribute data to make the product successful. This is because current commercial practices in machine learning seem to me to be fundamentally exploitative, and they unfairly inflate the importance of pretty simple algorithms over complex human expertise.</p>
