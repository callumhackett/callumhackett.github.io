                <p>>> Machine learning applied to music generation has had... mixed results. At best, we've seen gimmicks that tantalize but offer no lasting intrigue or practical tools. I'm working on a training pipeline to artificially generate improvisations that follow the rules of classical harmony. Interactive demos will be made available soon.</p>
                <p>>> I'm also employed as a computational linguist at a company specializing in speech recognition. My focus is on enhancing the naturalness of our text output, providing expert support for multi-lingual coverage thanks to a background in formal linguistics.</p>

                <p>Leptons interact only with photons, and with the intermediate bosons that presumably mediate weak interactions. What could be more natural than to unite these spin-one bosons into a multiplet of gauge fields? Standing in the way of this synthesis are the obvious dif- ferences in the masses of the photon and inter- mediate meson, and in their couplings. We might hope to understand these differences by imagining that the symmetries relating the weak and electromagnetic interactions are ex- act symmetries of the Lagrangian but are bro- ken by the vacuum. However, this raises the specter of unwanted massless Goldstone bosons. This note will describe a model in which the symmetry between the electromagnetic and weak interactions is spontaneously broken, but in which the Goldstone bosons are avoided by introducing the photon and the intermediate-boson fields as gauge fields. The model may be renormalizable.</p>
