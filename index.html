<em>Music in Pieces</em> is a limited series podcast about the <em>je ne sais quoi</em> of classical music. Currently in production, each episode will focus on a different aspect of musical structure, explored through musical examples and interviews with experts. Newcomers will find out what the genre does uniquely well, and aficionados will hear something fresh in the familiar.

While working on composition and voiceover projects, I often take notes on the creative process and audio production techniques, typically as a reminder of my decision-making process to help with future projects. Here, you can <a href="{{ site.url }}/studio-notes">click-through</a> to a section of the site where I share some notes as blog posts.
