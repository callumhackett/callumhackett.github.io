I'm a researcher in linguistics, philosophy and AI interested in a scientific account of intelligent systems, be they natural or man-made. I also dabble in problems of consciousness and the scientific method.

On the research landscape, you can find me at the intersection of [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism), [enactivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enactivism) and [quietism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quietism_(philosophy)). For me, intelligence is an explanatory tool, not an algorithm, and what it explains is embodied behaviour, not mental properties.

[I've published](/papers) on the biological and cognitive foundations of language, and I currently lead R&D at [UnlikelyAI](https://lab.unlikely.ai/){:target="_blank"}, where my team is designing trustworthy AI systems that are suitable for regulated industries.
