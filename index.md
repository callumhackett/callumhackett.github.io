# Callum Hackett

I'm a composer and AI research scientist. Previously a finalist in the NCEM and BBC Young Composers Award, my music makes use of eclectic styles and instruments, ranging from traditional orchestral to computer-assisted and electronic, with a focus on neoclassical idioms and narrative structure.

In my research, I'm primarily interested in the cognitive foundations of language and neurosymbolic models of intelligence. My current work concentrates on how we can make AI models better as creative assistants without undermining the human experience or the value of artistic labour.

I'm currently head of Language Engineering at [UnlikelyAI](https://www.unlikely.ai/).

*None of my own work which features algorithmic components ever uses AI models that are trained on other artists' data.*
