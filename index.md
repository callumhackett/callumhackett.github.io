# !Hello world?

With Syntactic Structures (1957) and Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), Chomsky spearheaded two revolutions in the study of language. In SS, his main innovation was to treat linguistic expressions as strings produced by a system of generative rules, for which he provided a formalism and evaluation procedures. In Aspects, he went far beyond string generation to propose a fundamentally cognitive model of sentence generation and understanding. Linguists are right to point to the later work as the real founding document of modern theory but I will argue that syntactic and pragmatic frameworks of the past fifteen years have been quietly breaking with the Aspects revolution and that this is because of certain assumptions we have inherited from Aspects that are neither necessary nor tenable.
