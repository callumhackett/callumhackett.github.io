# Callum Hackett

I'm an AI researcher and former linguist/philosopher primarily interested in the cognitive foundations of language and neurosymbolic models of intelligence. I'm also interested in problems of consciousness, ethics and the scientific method.

I'm currently head of Language Engineering at [UnlikelyAI](https://www.unlikely.ai/) in London. My team designs logical systems that complement language models in order to reliably automate decision-making in regulated industries.
