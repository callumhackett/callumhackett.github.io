# Callum Hackett

I'm a philosopher and AI researcher primarily interested in the cognitive foundations of language and neurosymbolic models of intelligence. I'm also interested in problems of consciousness, ethics and the scientific method.

I'm currently head of Language Engineering at [UnlikelyAI](https://www.unlikely.ai/) in London. My team designs symbolic components to complement language models in the automation of decision-making tasks (typically in regulated industries requiring trusted explanations).
