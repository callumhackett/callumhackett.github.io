# Callum Hackett

✹ I'm a researcher in linguistics, philosophy and AI interested in a scientific account of intelligent systems (be they natural or man-made). I also dabble in related problems of consciousness and the scientific method.

✹ [I've published](/pages/papers.html) on the biological and cognitive foundations of language, and am head of Language Engineering at [UnlikelyAI](https://www.unlikely.ai/), where my team designs logical systems to improve the reliability of language models in regulated industries.

✹ I write the blog [*Pell-Mell*](https://callumhackett.substack.com), which is an experiment in (nearly) free association. You may find occasional writing there on intelligent systems but it's just as likely you'll find art criticism, natural history, early modern science and so on.

✹ I sometimes publish other creative projects on YouTube, like [neoclassical electronica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MoHFhtfB_Y) and [dramatic readings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwLugzKpZ_k).
