# Callum Hackett
{:.site-title}

✹ I'm a researcher in linguistics, philosophy and AI interested in a scientific account of intelligent systems (be they natural or man-made). I also dabble in related problems of consciousness and the scientific method.

✹ [I've published](/pages/papers.html) on the biological and cognitive foundations of language, and I lead a team at [UnlikelyAI](https://www.unlikely.ai/) which is designing logical systems to improve the reliability of language models in regulated industries.

✹ I sometimes publish other creative projects, like [neoclassical electronica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MoHFhtfB_Y) and [dramatic readings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwLugzKpZ_k).
