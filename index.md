# Callum Hackett

▨ I'm an AI engineer and researcher in linguistics and philosophy, interested in a scientific account of intelligent systems (be they natural or man-made). I also dabble in problems of consciousness and the scientific method.

▨ I've published on the biological and cognitive foundations of language, and am head of Language Engineering at [UnlikelyAI](https://www.unlikely.ai/), where my team designs logical systems to complement language models for use in regulated industries.

▨ I write the blog [*Pell-Mell*](https://callumhackett.substack.com/about), which is an experiment in (nearly) free association. You may find occasional writing on intelligent systems there but it's just as likely that you'll find art criticism, natural history or early modern science and so on.

▨ I sometimes publish other creative projects on YouTube, like [neoclassical electronica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MoHFhtfB_Y) and [dramatic readings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwLugzKpZ_k).
