## [Justifications for a discontinuity theory of language evolution (2017)](/assets/papers/justifications_for_a_discontinuity_theory_of_language_evolution.pdf)

One of the major debates in theories of the origins of language is about whether it developed gradually from ancient, nonhuman communication systems or arose suddenly and uniquely in humans (in which case, call it a 'discontinuity'). For a special edition of [*Biolinguistics*](https://bioling.psychopen.eu/index.php/bioling), marking the 50th anniversary of Eric Lenneberg's influential *Biological Foundations of Language*, I develop several new arguments that favour a discontinuity theory. This is consistent with the view in generative linguistics (as expressed in Berwick & Chomsky's *Why Only Us*) but I reject the notion that what makes us unique is specifically the syntactic structure of language and thought. I argue that this is doubtful and what distinguishes us instead is our ability to represent thought (whatever its structure) using symbols.
