## [Justifications for a discontinuity theory of language evolution (2017)](/assets/papers/justifications_for_a_discontinuity_theory_of_language_evolution.pdf)

One of the major debates in theories of language origins is about whether language developed gradually from ancient, nonhuman communication systems or arose suddenly and uniquely in humans (in which case, we can call it an evolutionary 'discontinuity'). For a special edition of [*Biolinguistics*](https://bioling.psychopen.eu/index.php/bioling), marking the 50th anniversary of Eric Lenneberg's influential *Biological Foundations of Language*, I develop some arguments in favour of discontinuity theories. This is consistent with the view in generative linguistics (as expressed in Berwick & Chomsky's *Why Only Us*) but I reject the idea that what makes us unique is specifically the syntactic structure of language and thought. I argue that this is doubtful and what distinguishes us instead is our ability to *represent* thought (whatever its structure) using symbols.
