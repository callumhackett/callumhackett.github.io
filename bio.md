Callum Hackett is a composer, pianist and storyteller who works across several different media. Professionally a linguist with a background in bringing language diversity to the tech industry, he is a freelance artist with a non-traditional career. Having been a finalist in both the BBC Young Composer award and the Poetry Societyâ€™s National Poetry Competition, he has tirelessly explored the possibilities for narrative structure in aural media, be it music or the spoken word. Aside from self-published projects which seek to fuse classical forms with digital music production, he has been commissioned to produce commercial music and audiobooks.
