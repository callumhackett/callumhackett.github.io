<img id="bio-pic" src="assets/images/core/profile_pic.jpg" title="Callum Hackett"/>Callum Hackett is a composer, pianist and narrator who works in many different media. Professionally a linguist with a background in bringing language diversity to the tech industry, he works in parallel as a freelance musician and voiceover artist. Having been a finalist for both the BBC Young Composer award and the Poetry Societyâ€™s National Poetry Competition, he tirelessly explores the possibilities for narrative structure in aural media, be it music or the spoken word. Aside from developing self-published projects which seek to fuse classical forms with digital music production techniques, he has recently been commissioned to produce commercial music and audiobooks.
