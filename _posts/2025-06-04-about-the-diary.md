The reader may share a feeling with me that it seems prudent to keep a diary, though, in my case, I have not been able to settle upon a theme for such a thing, for the most obvious one --- myself --- holds little interest for me (which is not to say that I do not ruminate or introspect, for I do these in excess, but rather that I should not like to reify these habits by sitting down to them with pen and paper).

But the perceptive reader will recognise that I must have developed an answer to this conundrum, for here before them is a diary entry. However, I cannot tell the reader what the final purpose of this diary is, except cricumscriptively by relating to them how it was inspired by Freud's description of free association in [*The Interpretation of Dreams*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/66048){:target="_blank"} (1899):

<!--more-->

> For [dream interpretation], a certain psychic preparation of the patient is necessary. A double effort is made to stimulate his attention for his perceptions and to eliminate the critique with which he ordinarily views the thoughts which come to the surface in him. It is advantageous for concentrated self-observation for the patient to occupy a restful position, for him to close his eyes, and for him to be explicitly directed to relent in the critique of the thought-formations which he perceives. He must be told further that the success of the analysis depends upon his noticing and telling everything that passes through his mind, and that he must not allow himself to suppress an idea because it seems unimportant or irrelevant.

Freud goes on to observe that some of his patients struggle with these instructions and he likens the associative method to a sensitivity ordinarily found in artists, quoting Friedrich Schiller on a correspondent’s difficulties with creative expression:

> The reason for your complaint lies in the constraint which your mind imposes upon your imagination. It is harmful to the creative work of the soul if the mind inspects too closely the ideas pouring in at the gates, as it were … In an artist, the mind withdraws its watchers from the gates, the ideas rush in pell-mell, and it is only then that the great heap is looked over. Critics are ashamed or afraid of the transitory madness which is found in all creators, hence your complaints about barrenness: you reject too soon and discriminate too severely.

The reader who begins to understand my purpose in sharing these excerpts will realise that there is little I can say about the diary because to say anything would be to make certain discriminations which would suffocate its as yet unperceived potentials. The existence of the diary is simply an expression of belief in diary-keeping as a conduit of creative activity. This belief is the intuition we began with --- that there is surely some usefulness to diaries --- but I write without justification or design, for it seems to me that any further analysis of utility can only diminish that which it seeks to increase.

# The Need to Win

*from ['The Way of Chuang Tzu'](https://archive.org/details/wayofchuangtzu00mert/page/n7/mode/2up){:target="_blank"} by Thomas Merton*

When an archer is shooting for nothing<br />
He has all his skill.<br />
If he shoots for a brass buckle<br />
He is already nervous.<br />
If he shoots for a prize of gold<br />
He goes blind<br />
Or sees two targets---<br />
He is out of his mind!

His skill has not changed. But the prize<br />
Divides him. He cares.<br />
He thinks more of winning<br />
Than of shooting---<br />
And the need to win<br />
Drains him of power.
