I cannot tell you what this diary is about but I can tell you why I'm so constrained by describing how it was inspired by Freud's description of free association in [*The Interpretation of Dreams*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/66048){:target="_blank"} (1899):

> For [dream interpretation], a certain psychic preparation of the patient is necessary. A double effort is made to stimulate his attention for his perceptions and to eliminate the critique with which he ordinarily views the thoughts which come to the surface in him. It is advantageous for the purpose of concentrated self-observation for the patient to occupy a restful position, for him to close his eyes, and for him to be explicitly commanded to relent in the critique of the thought-formations which he perceives. He must be told further that the success of the analysis depends upon his noticing and telling everything that passes through his mind, and that he must not allow himself to suppress an idea because it seems unimportant or irrelevant.

Freud goes on to observe that some of his patients struggled with these instructions and he likens the practice to a sensitivity ordinarily found in artists, quoting Friedrich Schiller on a correspondent’s difficulties with creative expression:

> The reason for your complaint lies in the constraint which your mind imposes upon your imagination. It is harmful to the creative work of the soul if the mind inspects too closely the ideas pouring in at the gates, as it were … In an artist, the mind withdraws its watchers from the gates, the ideas rush in pêle-mêle, and it is only then that the great heap is looked over. Critics are ashamed or afraid of the transitory madness which is found in all creators, hence your complaints about barrenness: you reject too soon and discriminate too severely.

There is little I can say about the diary because to say anything would be to make a suffocating discrimination. Its existence is rather an expression of belief in diary-keeping as a model for creative activity.
