# Marcus Aurelius, the Meditations
{:.center-text}

When I read the [*Meditations*](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/marcus-aurelius/meditations/george-long){:target="_blank"} for the second or third time around ten years ago, I thought it would be useful to organise their major lessons in a format suitable for recitation. The six themed passages below --- all constituted of Aurelius's own words --- are the result of that exercise, and they serve as a general introduction to Stoic philosophy, which I comment on subsequently:

I live only in this fleeting moment of time, the rest of my life either already lived or lying in an unknowable future. The space of my existence is a small thing, lived on a small corner of the earth, where even the most enduring fame is swept into oblivion. Though the universe is orderly, my substance is a flux, my senses dull, the fabric of my body subject to corruption and my soul full of dream and delusion. Everything that belongs to me is a stream in flow, my life a brief stay in a foreign land.

Let philosophy serve as my escort and guide. Let it keep my spirit inviolate and superior to pleasure and pain so that I may welcome whatever is allotted to me by fate. And may it remind me that the person who is blessed by good fortune is the one who assigns a good lot to themselves with a good disposition of the soul, good impulses and good actions.
{:.initialised}

To be so blessed, may I exclude from my thoughts all that is aimless so that, at any moment, I could say what I am thinking with honesty and without hesitation and find my words free of idle curiosity, malice, envy, suspicion, desire, or anything else I would blush to admit, leaving all within me simple and benevolent. May I further purify myself of the defilements of earthly existence by reflecting upon the stars and examining how all things are transformed from one to another. And through such study, together with the veneration of my rational faculties, may I elevate my mind and strip away my body so that I may offer myself up without reservation when it is time for my dissolution and for my elements to be taken back into the generative substance of the universe.
{:.initialised}

But while I live, unless it is for the common good, may I not waste what remains of my life forming impressions of others or wishing to impress upon them, instead making sure that I do nothing at random, nothing that depends on the doings of others, and nothing with false intent or pretence. And if a person does wrong, may I not work against or be aggrieved by them, but rather instruct them in a kindly manner and consider what similar faults I commit, or otherwise leave wrongdoing to its author so that I am not diverted from paying proper attention to my own ruling centre. Moreover, may I gladden my heart with images of the virtues that shine forth in those around me so that I may better serve to perfect the social system of which I am a part, never evading its obligations and always doing good for its own sake. In this, may I remember that I am a limb of the common body formed by all rational beings, which is a special unity that any of us may return to even after we have been severed from it.
{:.initialised}

Yet, may I foremost find the greatest peace and ease of mind by retreating into myself, such that I may be cleansed of my distresses and sent back into the world without discontent. For though we exist primarily for the sake of one another, each individual has their own ruling centre and independent authority. It is thus through my own inner renewal that the world is made bearable and I am made bearable to the world.
{:.initialised}

Then, whenever I must act, may I devote myself in a resolute spirit to the tasks I am set with a scrupulous and unaffected dignity, with love for others, independence and justice. May all my actions be purposeful, selfless, measured and thoughtful, and undertaken with a cheerful face shown to the world. And if my activities are hindered by some obstacle, may I accept it with good grace and swiftly redirect my efforts to what is practicable and still accords with my goal. And if I am not wholly successful in every action, may I neither feel guilt nor lose heart but instead remember how easy it is, at any moment, to repel and wipe away every disturbing or inappropriate thought and recover at once a perfect calm.

It’s hard to argue with such noble thoughts but I will argue with them nonetheless. However, to give an effective appraisal of Stoic philosophy, it’s important to begin with some rough separation between questions of ethics and questions of psychology, which is related to the classical distinction between [*eudaimonia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia){:target="_blank"} (well-being) and [*ataraxia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia){:target="_blank"} (freedom from suffering).

We know, for example, that Stoicism has been an inspiration for mental health interventions like [cognitive behavioural therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy){:target="_blank"}, yet the health industry is not in the business of giving instruction in virtuous living. What is the nature of this disconnection? One way to make sense of it is to recognise that Stoic teachings are as much about what is (materially) bad for a person as they are about what is (morally) good for humanity, and, though these are related, they are to some degree independent. Consider the observation that, since death is inevitable, a person who lives in fear of it will find it difficult to maintain their happiness — reaching this conclusion does not require any ethical commitments, and, though resolving it by accepting our mortality can inform our ethics, it can do so in a variety of ways. Hence, the various classical philosophies overlap considerably in their accounts of *ataraxia* but less so in their accounts of *eudaimonia*.

This being the case, our society has straightforwardly imported Stoic ideas about the causes of suffering — regarding them as a kind of precocious, pre-scientific psychology — while ignoring the ethics as irrelevant to contemporary life. I don’t think this is an inauthenticity so much as a reflection of the multi-faceted nature of classical philosophy. This is also supported by the history: while it is typical of modern philosophy, with its love for formalisation, to treat Stoicism as an integrated body of doctrine, the school originally arose out of a lineage of personality cults that venerated Socrates, and some of its writings simply emulate Socratic doubt and detachment without any pretence of ethical system-building. To the extent that this is the project of Aurelius’s *Meditations*, they are a jewel of classical literature, but where they do go further and make claims about the nature of virtue, we should be more skeptical.

Stoicism is rooted in the idea that Nature is rational and purposeful, and, as Aurelius writes, “all’s right that happens in the world.” The reason why this pronouncement doesn’t immediately end all ethical questions (what is there to wonder about if everything is necessarily good?) is that the human being in some way stands apart from Nature, such that they can either live in accordance with it or rebel, and Stoics claim that virtue is to be found in accordance, while rebellion leads to suffering.

There is some nuance to this that requires some care. For the Stoic, living in accordance with Nature amounts to developing one’s self-sufficiency, so that happiness is possible come what may (equally, rebelling against Nature amounts to making demands upon it which might not be satisfied). But if the Stoic really has nothing more to do than generate their own peace from within, one might ask what substance there is to the idea of living in *accordance* with Nature, as it seems that the Stoic really wants to deny having any relationship with Nature at all. This is a misunderstanding, common in modern interpretations of Stoicism, which err by thinking that the freedom we have in how we respond to our circumstances means that we are entirely separate from Nature. Stoicism does recognise humans as part of Nature, and therefore as having a nature of their own, but we are prone to internal discord and self-sufficiency is to be achieved by eliminating it.

Although I said earlier that tools like cognitive behavioural therapy are not inauthentic, this is where they nonetheless lack nuance — for a classical Stoic, no sense can be made of the search for inner peace except through an understanding of human nature, whereas modern culture would rather treat this issue as opaque and consider people individualistically, leading to mealy-mouthed advice that reduces to telling people to Other their emotions and dominate them (what Nietzsche calls self-tyranny in *Beyond Good and Evil*). 

Another misunderstanding can arise over the claim that living in accordance with nature just *is* virtue. This is deliberately meant to be quasi-definitional rather than an empirical hypothesis. For the Greeks, regarding Nature as infused with purpose led them to think of ‘virtue’ as skilfull fulfilment of purpose (*i.e.* they thought of it in terms of virtuosity rather than virtuousness). From a modern standpoint, it’s easy to mistake virtue for some kind of practice that begets well-being, such that one might try to discover, as a matter of fact, whether rebelling against Nature could lead to greater well-being. In the classical worldview, this is a contradiction — if it turned out that some supposed rebellion was good for us, this would simply reveal that it was actually a virtue that had been misidentified. Thus, the critical issue in all classical ethics is the proper characterisation of human nature.

For any classical thinker, human nature was to be understood contrastively, as *human* nature — that which distinguishes us from other beings. Stoics agreed with the consensus that humans are uniquely rational beings, and they further contended that we are social beings, hence their emphasis on civic responsibility in contrast to the Epicureans and the Cynics. Thus, to refine the description I gave earlier, we can say that, for the Stoic, living in accordance with nature amounts to *using one’s rationality* to achieve self-sufficiency, understanding ‘self-sufficiency’ to admit of some social obligations.

Of course, the Stoics also had much to say about the cardinal virtues — wisdom, justice, courage and temperance — but I think these are nothing more than the manifestation of the logic of self-sufficiency in different domains of human activity, and the way the Stoics identified and described them is not essential to their thinking. For example, the Stoic idea of courage has less to do with machismo and heroism than with dignified acceptance of hardship, which is just mastery of the self over external conditions. Even justice, which seems more quintessentially selfless, can be regarded in terms of partaking in a social contract which aids our own security. An appraisal of Stoicism therefore comes down to this: how defensible is an ethics based on the rational pursuit of self-sufficiency?

Let me first of all say that I do not find it problematic that Stoicism arrives at this only by assuming that humans do have *some* purpose, whereas the characteristic problem of modern ethics is the supposed purposelessness of human existence. I think we are purposeless only in the sense that we have learned that ‘purpose’ is a concept we can do without, but to the extent that our well-being might be predicated on the refinement and use of our evolved capabilities (and this seems plausible to me), it is entirely valid to ask whether the rational pursuit of self-sufficiency is the best characterisation we can have of what we should strive for.

With regards to self-sufficiency, the inclusion of sociality within the concept is why I turned to Stoicism rather than its opponent schools when I first became interested in classical ethics. The Stoics have certainly been vindicated by the biological evidence, in that we know social intelligence was absolutely key to evolutionary advances in the hominin lineage which now define our current form of life. In fact, when philosophers speak of rationality as the primary human quality, they are simultaneously speaking about language, which is an irreducibly social phenomenon. Without language and the possibilities it affords for society, we would not have civilization — the Epicureans and the Cynics who turn away from social obligations are hypocrites and savages.

It also seems sensible to me that the broader concept of self-sufficiency should be an outcome of virtuous living, insofar as what it means is that a flourishing human being is one who is not defective or incomplete. But trouble sets in when the Stoic specifically tries to use reasoning to understand self-sufficiency in order to attain it. Stoics have a reputation for tending towards austerity and aloofness, and, though defenders of Stoicism will say that this is a caricature and that one has to have the sufficiently sophisticated definition of self-sufficiency in mind to be *really* virtuous, I think this is the same kind of mistake that the utilitarian makes when they say that the abhorrent outcomes of utilitarian calculations are only the result of *bad* calculations, and a more complete quantification of utility would lead us to something more palatable.

The problem with this is that the utility of an action can conceivably have an infinite number of dimensions which we cannot reasonably grasp, and, in just the same way, there is no finite, expressible conception of self-sufficiency which can reliably help us decide how to respond to the infinite variety of circumstances we can find ourselves in. The tendency of the Stoic to fit the stereotype is the direct result of Stoicism’s effort to reason its way to the right actions by a principle of self-sufficiency, rather than intuiting what self-sufficiency amounts to by first acting in the right way.

There is something counter-intuitive in this criticism, so let me state it another way. The Stoic’s problem is not their valuing of self-sufficiency but rather their belief that they can rationally understand what self-sufficiency is *independent* of the infinite material circumstances it might describe. The Stoic gets it exactly backwards: self-sufficiency is not an abstract principle that defines good behaviour, it’s an abstraction *from* good behaviour which attempts to elucidate its nature. By taking the abstraction as a fixed rule rather than as a revisable generalisation, the Stoic opens themselves up to making choices that are intuitively abnormal (such as ruminating on the death of loved ones to try to steel oneself for grief in order to overcome it as quickly as possible), when really their intuition *is* their morality, which their principle has undermined.

Given this argument, it would be wrong of me to suggest a refinement to Stoic principles — Stoicism is about as good as principles-based ethics gets but all principles-based ethics is flawed. But to the extent that it’s sensible to try to seek some guidance in theory, I think it’s more useful to look for virtue in modes of being. For this, I’m particularly taken with the idea of effortless action (*wu wei*) in Taoism, which naturally begets self-sufficiency without trying to define it such that it becomes distorted. In fact, the Taoist critique of Confucianism is almost the same as my critique of Stoicism. In *The Way of Chuang Tzu*, Thomas Merton summarises it like this:

> The character of the ‘Superior Man’ or ‘Noble Minded Man’ [*i.e.* the Stoic sage] … is constructed around a four-sided mandala of basic virtues.
>
> … [Chuang Tzu’s] chief complaint [with this] was that [it] did not go far enough. It produced well-behaved and virtuous officials, indeed cultured men. But it nevertheless limited and imprisoned them within fixed external norms and consequently made it impossible for them to act really freely and creatively in response to the ever new demands of unforeseen situations.
>
> … The more one seeks “the good” outside oneself as something to be acquired, the more one is faced with the necessity of discussing, studying, understanding, analyzing the nature of the good. The more, therefore, one becomes involved in abstractions and in the confusion of divergent opinions. The more “the good” is objectively analyzed, the more it is treated as something to be attained by special virtuous techniques, the less real it becomes. As it becomes less real, it recedes further into the distance of abstraction, futurity, unattainability. The more, therefore, one concentrates on the means to be used to attain it. And as the end becomes more remote and more difficult, the means become more elaborate and complex, until finally the mere study of the means becomes so demanding that all one’s effort must be concentrated on this, and the end is forgotten.
>
> … “If you ask ‘what ought to be done’ and ‘what ought not to be done’ on earth to produce happiness, I answer that these questions do not have [a fixed and predetermined] answer” to suit every case. If one is in harmony with Tao … the answer will make itself clear when the time comes to act, for then one will act not according to the human and self-conscious mode of deliberation, but according to the divine and spontaneous mode of *wu wei*.

This is emphatically not an advocacy for an irreflective or relativistic ethics — Taoism still argues for harmony with a pre-existing nature, but it recognises that the proper role of rationality is to mount critiques of behaviours which are *disharmonious* with nature, so that the path is freed for spontaneous, unanalysed virtuosity. In contrast, it is a great irony and tragedy of the *Meditations* that Aurelius preaches self-sufficiency so movingly, and yet it eluded him all his life, for he continually had to remind himself of where to look for it, having made it something external which he had to recover.
