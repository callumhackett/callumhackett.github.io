# Fifty Shades of Blue Grey

{% include image.html image-file="cabbage.webp" image-class="img-right" %}

[Last time](/2025/06/21/sea-holly.html), the language of botany introduced me to the word _glaucous_. Generally defined as a dull or pale grey-blue or grey-green, it’s not a word you usually see outside of biology, where it’s used for all sorts of flowers, fruits and vegetables (think especially of the glistening appearance of wine grapes or unwashed red cabbage), as well as animals like the glaucous macaw and the glaucous gull (for its grey wings). Writing this, I realise that my living room is also glaucous, since I painted it a soft green that was impressionistically called _feathers of a dove_.

‘Glaucous’ is particularly common in ornithology, in fact, as in 1886 Robert Ridgway published _A Nomenclature of Colors for Naturalists_, in which he promoted the use of the word for the precise description of birds. By the time of his 1912 _Color Standards and Color Nomenclature_, which had much bigger ambitions to standardise all colour terminology, he rather hysterically laid claim to having named 1,115 distinct colours, 20 of them glaucous shades. This was his stated motivation for his work:

> The terminology of Science, the Arts, and various Industries has been a most important factor in the development of their present high efficiency. Measurements, weights, mathematical and chemical formulae, and terms which clearly designate practically every variation of form and structure, have long been standardized; but the nomenclature of colors remains vague and, for practical purposes, meaningless, thereby seriously impeding progress in almost every branch of industry and research.

Well, thank goodness we’re all using ‘greenish glaucous blue’ now…

Looking at his samples and considering them in the context of their use in biological description, it seems to me that ‘glaucous’ really conveys texture as much as colour (and perhaps other dimensions of appearance besides) — is it genuinely possible to appreciate the glaucous purple of a grape without also imagining the waxiness of its skin between your thumb and forefinger? Or perhaps it has something to do with the way the colour catches the light in motion, the word ‘glaucous’ coming from a Greek word (_glaukos_) that Homer used to describe the gleaming sea (apparently without a specific colour connotation):

> [Achilles] you are merciless. Surely<br />
Peleus was not thy father, nor the queen<br />
Thetis thy mother; rather, the gleaming sea<br />
and jagged rock faces brought you forth,<br />
so savage is your heart.

Ridgway’s project was doomed to failure because his approach made little practical sense: decontextualised colours are hard to map onto real objects whose appearances change with changes in physical conditions, and neither science nor industry stood to benefit from rote memorisation or repetitious lookup of a thousand atomised shades. This was already noticed by Albert Henry Munsell when he published his own _A Color Notation_ a few years earlier in 1905:

>The incongruous and bizarre nature of our present color names must appear to any thoughtful person. Baby blue, peacock blue, Nile green, apple green, lemon yellow, straw yellow, rose pink, heliotrope, royal purple, Magenta, Solferino, plum, and automobile are popular terms, conveying different ideas to different persons and utterly failing to define colors. The terms used for a single hue, such as pea green, sea green, olive green, grass green, sage green, evergreen, invisible green, are not to be trusted in ordering a piece of cloth. They invite mistakes and disappointment.

Munsell came up with a different kind of colour system that’s still in use today — you’ll find it everywhere from RGB colour pickers on your computer to the science of colour perception — and it was so successful because it’s a _geometry_: rather than specifying colours by name, you specify them by their quantity of certain attributes (typically hue, chroma and value, or variations on these, such as hue, saturation and lightness).

This particular chart, with its clear separation of the constituent axes of colour, is the best demonstration of colour as a composite phenomenon, but the fact that it’s a geometry means you can also represent colour relationships with so-called colour solids — spheres, cones or cubes, whose surfaces mark the limits of what humans can perceive. In this, Munsell’s system was anticipated by the 1810 _Farbenkugel_ (colour sphere) of the German artist Philipp Otto Runge:

If you wanted to make a psychologically accurate colour solid, you’d need to construct an asymmetrical, pimply ball that would only approximate a sphere, as our eyes don’t respond to light linearly across the visible spectrum. For example, when comparing a yellow and blue with equal _physical_ saturation and lightness (as measured by their spectral profiles), people will judge the yellow to be _perceptually_ lighter.

Issues of colour perception are a particular obsession in the philosophy of consciousness, in my estimate to a distracting and unhelpful degree but the field has entertained me lately with questions about whether there’s any _necessity_ in the structure of the colour space. Imagine an organism which has only luminosity detection (no colour awareness), for example: we would imagine this as grayscale vision, with white and black as its two poles, but could biology in principle create a *red*scale (or *green*scale and so on)? Would red as an opposite to black be less biologically adaptive because it’s less contrastive? What *is* contrast, scientifically?

I suspect these are not sensible questions: I only think of white and red in the way I do because I already have both of them with their own mutual contrast. Given only a luminosity dimension, perhaps black and white do not have a _property_ of contrast which they hold to some degree, they just _are_ contrast. In that case, no, nature could not create redscale, but equally, ‘white’ is not really the right word for maximum brightness in a true grayscale.

Still, as much as I imagine there is less arbitrariness in colour perception than modern philosophy would have us believe — I do think colour must ultimately be physical, rather than a concoction of spirit — I wouldn’t go so far as to join the colour realists (_i.e._ people who believe that colours are just inherent properties of objects. As untenable as it sounds, an interesting defense is made in [this paper](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/50993/Color%20Realism%20and%20Color%20Science.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)).

One thing worth remembering is that in all colour systems and philosophical discussions, colour words are used with a double meaning: ‘red’ is both the colour of specific objects with determinate shades (_this_ apple, _this_ rose, _this_ beetle) and also the hue that can take on many shades, which is an abstraction we’ve never seen (it’s just what the apple, the rose and the beetle have in common). Likewise, there are arguably colours which are not expressible in the Munsell colour system because they cannot be represented without further dimensions like transparency and reflectiveness. There is no RGB profile that will give you a fully satisfying gold, brass or porcelain (I note that, as well as being colour terms, these are all materials, which is no coincidence, but I don’t think this undermines their status as colours — the substance gold is not simply yellow-brown). So it remains unclear to me whether we’ve even settled what colour _is_, for us to be able to talk about how it arises in the mind.

## A palette of colour terms
**amber**, from _ambergris_, for the sperm whale secretion; the resin used to be called _elektron_ by the Greeks (rubbing it can create static charge)<br />
**auburn**, surprisingly from Latin _albus_, ‘white’, shifting over time through various off-whites, possibly also influenced by proximity to Middle English _brun_, ‘brown’<br />
**azure**, ultimately from Persian _lāžward_, which refers to lapis lazuli<br />
**carmine**, from Latin _carminium_, ultimately perhaps Sanskrit _krmi_, ‘insect’, since the colour used to be collected from insect bodies (see _crimson_)<br />
**cerulean**, from Latin _caeruleus_, also denoting the colour, likely related to _caelum_, ‘sky’<br />
**chartreuse**, named after the colour of a liqueur made by a Carthusian monastery in the Chartreuse mountains of France<br />
**coral**, from Latin _corallium_, for the stony substance secreted by marine polyps used in jewellery and ornaments<br />
**crimson**, from Old Italian _carmesi_, ultimately perhaps Sanskrit krmi, ‘insect’, since the colour used to be collected from insect bodies (see _carmine_)<br />
**fuchsia**, Latinsation of the surname of botanist Leonhard Fuchs (1501-1566)<br />
**magenta**, the dye was discovered in 1859 and was named in commemoration of the Battle of Magenta the same year<br />
**mauve**, from Latin _malva_, ‘mallow’, by resemblance to the mallow flower<br />
**ochre**, from Greek _khros_, ‘pale yellow’, of unknown origin<br />
**umber**, either from Latin _umbra_, ‘shadow’, or the Italian region Umbria<br />
**vermilion**, from Latin _vermiculus_, ‘little worm’, since the colour used to be collected from the cochineal insect<br />
