This is the source of [Callum Hackett's website](https://callumhackett.github.io/), which was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

The visual design is inspired by [the Arts & Crafts movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement), which I think is not just visually appealing but also as philosophically relevant today as it was when it was rebelling against 19th century mechanisation.

The website background is a popular wallpaper by William Morris, the [Willow Bough](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/384022).

The title font is [Sorts Mill Goudy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sorts+Mill+Goudy), based on the work of [Frederic Goudy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Goudy), and the body font is [Source Serif 4](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4), more loosely based on the work of [Pierre-Simon Fournier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Simon_Fournier). Source Serif communicates some of the humanist aesthetic I wanted for the website, though my ideal would be an open source version of [Plantin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantin_(typeface)), which I am sad does not exist.

The initials originate with [engravings made in 1843](https://archive.org/details/alphabetsnumeral00shaw/page/n5/mode/2up) which were used in an 1847 printing of Euclid's *Elements*, which was in turn beautifully [digitised](https://c82.net/euclid/) by [Nicholas Rougeux](https://c82.net/).

There is some artifice in the writing style of the diary which was partly inspired by 18th century scientific papers published by the Royal Society of London in their journal, the [*Philosophical Transactions*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/loi/rstl/group/c1700.d1700.y1700).
