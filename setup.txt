Tips
- Code blocks with the standard `{%` and `%}` surrounds create unwanted HTML whitespace. This is removed if you instead
use `{%-` and `-%}`.
- HTML blocks cannot be given directly to an include statement, but you can use a `capture` to assign a block to a
variable and then pass the variable to the include statement.
- Jekyll does not permit negatives in `if` statements. Instead, `unless` is an `if not` expression.
- There are various filters for handling strings, such as `remove`, `replace` and `split`. Content should generally be
called with the `smartify` filter, which turns straight quotes into curly quotes.
- To add switchable content, use:

<div class="switchable switched"></div>

<script>
    function showContent(name) {
        // Hide all paragraphs
        document.querySelectorAll('.switchable').forEach(p => {
            p.classList.remove('switched');
        });
        // Show the selected paragraph
        document.getElementById(name).classList.add('switched');
    }
</script>
