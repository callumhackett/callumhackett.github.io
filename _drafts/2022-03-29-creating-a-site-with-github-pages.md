I felt that the documentation for creating a site with GitHub pages was not particularly helpful, especially considering the fact that there are several different use cases, with workflows and requirements that don't overlap. You might want to create a browser-based version of documentation inside a pre-existing GitHub project; you might want to create a bespoke website using a pre-built theme and pages generated via markdown (not HTML or CSS knowledge required); or - if you fall into my camp - you might want a blank canvas that lets you create your own HTML and CSS templates from scratch, while nonetheless providing the option to use markdown files as well. This latter use case in particular I felt was not well catered for, as you really don't need any of the Jekyll bloat intended to help people who don't want to design the website themselves. So, if you just want to use GitHub pages as a hosting platform and want to do your own design while testing the layout on your local machine, follow these steps.
