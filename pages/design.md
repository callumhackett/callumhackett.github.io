The visual design of the site is inspired by [the Arts & Crafts movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement){:target="_blank"}, which not only has a glorious neo-Gothic aesthetic but also a humanism which is as philosophically relevant today as it was when rebelling against 19<sup>th</sup> century mass production techniques.

The background is a popular wallpaper motif by [William Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris){:target="_blank"}: the [Willow Bough](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/384022){:target="_blank"}.

The title font is [Sorts Mill Goudy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sorts+Mill+Goudy){:target="_blank"}, based on the work of [Frederic Goudy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Goudy){:target="_blank"}, and the body font is [Source Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4){:target="_blank"}, more loosely based on the work of [Pierre-Simon Fournier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Simon_Fournier){:target="_blank"}. Source Serif captures some of the naturalism I had in mind, though my ideal would be an open source version of [Plantin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantin_(typeface)){:target="_blank"}, which I am sad does not exist.

The initials used in [the diary entries](/diary) and some [reviews](/reviews) are ultimately based on engravings found in 16<sup>th</sup> century printings of the [*Roman de la Rose*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_la_Rose){:target="_blank"}. These served as models for [an 1847 edition of Euclid's *Elements*](https://archive.org/details/firstsixbooksofe00byrn){:target="_blank"}, which was beautifully [digitised](https://c82.net/euclid/){:target="_blank"} with a font for the initials by [Nicholas Rougeux](https://c82.net/){:target="_blank"}.

There is also some deliberate artifice in the writing style of the diary entries, inspired by 18<sup>th</sup> century papers published by the Royal Society of London in their [*Philosophical Transactions*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/loi/rstl/group/c1700.d1700.y1700){:target="_blank"}.
