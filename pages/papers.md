## [Justifications for a discontinuity theory of language evolution](/assets/papers/Justifications_for_a_discontinuity_theory_of_language_evolution.pdf)

One of the major debates in theories of language origins is about whether language is a quantitative development of nonhuman communication systems or something entirely unique to humans (in which case, we can call it an evolutionary 'discontinuity'). For a special edition of *Biolinguistics* marking the 50th anniversary of Eric Lenneberg's influential *Biological Foundations of Language*, I develop some arguments in favour of a discontinuity theory. This is consistent with the view in generative linguistics (*i.e.* the position associated with Chomsky) but I reject the mainstream claim that what makes us unique is the syntactic structure of language and thought. I argue instead that what distinguishes us is our ability to *represent* thought (whatever its structure) using socially-grounded symbols.
