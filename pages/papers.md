## [Justifications for a discontinuity theory of language evolution](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003858)

One of the major debates in theories of language origins is about whether language is a complex development of nonhuman communication systems or an entirely novel ability (in which case, we can call it an evolutionary discontinuity). For a special edition of *Biolinguistics* marking the 50th anniversary of Eric Lenneberg's influential *Biological Foundations of Language*, I give some arguments in favour of discontinuity theories. This is consistent with the view in generative linguistics (*i.e.* the position associated with Chomsky) but I reject the generative claim that what makes us unique is the syntactic structure of language and thought. I argue instead that what distinguishes us is our ability to *represent* thought (whatever its structure) using socially-grounded symbols.
