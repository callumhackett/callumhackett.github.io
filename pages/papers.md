## [Justifications for a discontinuity theory of language evolution](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003858){:target="_blank"}

One of the major debates in theories of language origins is about whether human language is an extension of communication abilities found in other animals or is an entirely novel ability (in which case, we can call it an evolutionary discontinuity). For a special edition of *Biolinguistics* marking the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Eric Lenneberg's influential *Biological Foundations of Language*, I give some arguments in favour of discontinuity theories. This is consistent with the position in generative linguistics (the one associated with Chomsky) but I reject the generative view that what makes us unique is the syntactic structure of language and thought. I argue that that structure exists but is widespread and what distinguishes us is our ability to *represent* thought using socially-grounded symbols.
