## [Justifications for a discontinuity theory of language evolution](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003858){:target="_blank"}

One of the major debates in theories of language origins is about whether human language is a complex extension of communicative abilities shared by other species or an entirely novel animals (in which case, we can call it an evolutionary discontinuity). For a special edition of *Biolinguistics* marking the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Eric Lenneberg's influential *Biological Foundations of Language*, I give some arguments in favour of discontinuity. This is consistent with the position in generative linguistics (*i.e.* the position associated with Chomsky) but I reject the generative view that what makes us unique is the syntactic structure of language and thought. I argue instead that this structure exists but is widespread and what distinguishes us is our ability to *represent* thought using socially-grounded symbols.
