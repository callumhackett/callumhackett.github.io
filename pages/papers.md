## [Justifications for a discontinuity theory of language evolution (2017)](/assets/papers/Justifications_for_a_discontinuity_theory_of_language_evolution.pdf)

One of the major debates in theories of language origins is about whether language is a development of nonhuman communication systems or something entirely unique to humans (in which case, we can call it an evolutionary 'discontinuity'). For a special edition of [*Biolinguistics*](https://bioling.psychopen.eu/index.php/bioling) marking the 50th anniversary of Eric Lenneberg's influential *Biological Foundations of Language*, I develop some arguments in favour of discontinuity theories. This is consistent with the view in generative linguistics (as expressed in Berwick & Chomsky's *Why Only Us*) but I reject the idea that it's the syntactic structure of language and thought that makes us unique. I argue instead that what distinguishes us is our ability to *represent* thought (whatever its structure) using socially-grounded symbols.
